# Jon Lester Heatmaps

This app shows heatmaps based on pitches thrown by Cubs pitcher Jon Lester from the start of the 2016 season until today. I went the conventional route and divided the pitches up by type, but the data set allows them to be displayed based on base state, pitch result, count, and more.

I built the app in Ruby using the Sinatra framework. The graphs are generated by Plotly via their REST API.
