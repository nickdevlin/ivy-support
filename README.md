# Jon Lester Heatmaps

This app shows heatmaps based on pitches thrown by Cubs pitcher Jon Lester from the start of the 2016 season until today. The pitches are divided up by type, though the JSON object containing the pitch data allows for pitches to be divided based on base state, pitch result, count, and more.

I built the app in the Sinatra framework using Ruby. The graphs are generated by Plotly via their REST API.

The app is deployed to Heroku.
